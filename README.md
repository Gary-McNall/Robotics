The Robot Sonographer contains a ROBOTC file that was a project of mine during my sophomore year at Western Washington University.

The Robot Sonographer is a two wheeled robot that could track its position using wheel geometry. The robot could also build 2 dimensional maps of its surrounding environment using a motor mounted sonar scanner. The project worked reasonably well, the maps were coherent and the robot was able to track its position with high precision, especially when given a linear path to follow.

The code is somewhat superfluous and the variable names are a bit wordy but it was fun project that I would like to share with the communiity.
